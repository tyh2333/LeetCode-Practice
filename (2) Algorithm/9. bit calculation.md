#### [268. Missing Number](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/missing-number/)

Given an array `nums` containing `n` distinct numbers in the range `[0, n]`, return *the only number in the range that is missing from the array.*

**Follow up:** Could you implement a solution using only `O(1)` extra space complexity and `O(n)` runtime complexity?

**Example 1:**

```c++
Input: nums = [3,0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
 
// Constraints:
n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 104
0 <= nums[i] <= n
All the numbers of nums are unique.
```

```c++
// (method 1) XOR: '^'
// XOR has Commutative law: 
//  a^b = b^a and (a^b)^c = a^(b^c) and a^a = 0
// 	missing = 4∧(0∧0)∧(1∧1)∧(2∧3)∧(3∧4)
// 			=(4∧4)∧(0∧0)∧(1∧1)∧(3∧3)∧2
// 			=0∧0∧0∧0∧2
// 			=2 （2 is missing）
class Solution {
public:
        int missingNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
            int res = nums.size();
            for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i){
                res ^= nums[i];
                res ^= i;
            }
            return res;
        }
};
```

```c++
// (method 2) Sum(0 to n) - all = missing;
class Solution {
public:
    int missingNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        int res = ((n + 1) * n) >> 1;
        for (auto num : nums)
            res -= num;
        return res;
    }
};
```

```c++
// (method 3) bucket sort
class Solution {
public:
    int missingNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = (int) nums.size();
        vector<int> tmp(n + 1, 0);
        for(auto x: nums){
            tmp[x]++;
        }
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            if(tmp[i] == 0){
                return i;
            }
        }
        return n;
    }
};
```



#### [476. Number Complement](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/number-complement/)

The **complement** of an integer is the integer you get when you flip all the `0`'s to `1`'s and all the `1`'s to `0`'s in its binary representation.

- For example, The integer `5` is `"101"` in binary and its **complement** is `"010"` which is the integer `2`.

Given an integer `num`, return *its complement*. 

**Example 1:**

```c++
Input: num = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```c++
Input: num = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= num < 231` 

**Note:** This question is the same as 1009: https://leetcode.com/problems/complement-of-base-10-integer/

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int findComplement(int num) {
        int temp = num;
        int c = 0;
        // get how many bits num has and XOR with same length all bits 1;
        while(temp > 0){
            temp >>= 1; // the number of loops is log(num)
            c =  (c << 1) + 1; // build c with 1 on every bit
        }
        // XOR num and c: to flip every bit of num:
        // 0 XOR 1 becomes 1
        // 1 XOR 1 becomes 0
        return num ^ c;
    }
};
```

#### [583. Delete Operation for Two Strings](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/delete-operation-for-two-strings/)

Given two strings `word1` and `word2`, return *the minimum number of **steps** required to make* `word1` *and* `word2` *the same*. In one **step**, you can delete exactly one character in either string. 

**Example 1:**

```c++
Input: word1 = "sea", word2 = "eat"
Output: 2
Explanation: You need one step to make "sea" to "ea" and another step to make "eat" to "ea".
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 500`
- `word1` and `word2` consist of only lowercase English letters.

```c++
// the min steps to make first i word1 and first j word2 same
class Solution {
public:
    int minDistance(string word1, string word2) {
        int n = word1.size();
        int m = word2.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n + 1, vector<int>(m + 1));
        // must init dp[i][0] and dp[0][j]
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) dp[i][0] = i;
        for (int j = 0; j <= m; j++) dp[0][j] = j;

        // bc from i-1 to get 1, j-1 to get j, so i,j all start from 1 to n,m
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= m; j++) {
                if (word1[i - 1] == word2[j - 1]) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1];
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = min({dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 2, dp[i - 1][j] + 1, dp[i][j - 1] + 1});
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[n][m];
    }
};
```

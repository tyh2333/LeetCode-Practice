#### [395. Longest Substring with At Least K Repeating Characters](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/longest-substring-with-at-least-k-repeating-characters/)

Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, return *the length of the longest substring of* `s` *such that the frequency of each character in this substring is greater than or equal to* `k`. 

**Example 1:**

```c++
Input: s = "aaabb", k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest substring is "aaa", as 'a' is repeated 3 times.
```

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    // key point: divide and conquer:
    //  if freq of c < k, spilt string into two parts:
    // the left of c and the right of c;
    int longestSubstring(string s, int k) {
        if(k <= 1) return s.size();
        unordered_map<int, int> mp;
        if (s.empty() || s.size() < k) return 0;
        for(auto c : s) mp[c]++;
        int i = 0;
        while(i < s.size() && mp[s[i]] >= k) i++; // trim
        if(i == s.size()) return s.size(); // must have this, bc use s[i] in the future.
        int l = longestSubstring(s.substr(0, i), k);
        while(i < s.size() && mp[s[i]] >= k) i++; // trim
        int r = longestSubstring(s.substr(i), k);
        return max(l, r);
    }
};
```



#### [1274. Number of Ships in a Rectangle](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/number-of-ships-in-a-rectangle/)

*(This problem is an **interactive problem**.)*

Each ship is located at an integer point on the sea represented by a cartesian plane, and each integer point may contain at most 1 ship.

You have a function `Sea.hasShips(topRight, bottomLeft)` which takes two points as arguments and returns `true` If there is at least one ship in the rectangle represented by the two points, including on the boundary.

Given two points: the top right and bottom left corners of a rectangle, return the number of ships present in that rectangle. It is guaranteed that there are **at most 10 ships** in that rectangle.

Submissions making **more than 400 calls** to `hasShips` will be judged *Wrong Answer*. Also, any solutions that attempt to circumvent the judge will result in disqualification.

**Example :**

```c++
Input: 
ships = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3],[5,5]], topRight = [4,4], bottomLeft = [0,0]
Output: 3
Explanation: From [0,0] to [4,4] we can count 3 ships within the range.
```

```c++
// On the input ships is only given to initialize the map internally. You must solve this problem "blindfolded". In other words, you must find the answer using the given hasShips API, without knowing the ships position.

class Solution {
public:
    // divide and conquer
    int countShips(Sea sea, vector<int> topRight, vector<int> bottomLeft) {
        int t = topRight[0];
        int r = topRight[1];
        int b = bottomLeft[0];
        int l = bottomLeft[1];
        if(t < b || l > r || sea.hasShips(topRight, bottomLeft) == 0) return 0;
        if(topRight == bottomLeft) return 1;
        int mid_x = (l+r)/2;
        int mid_y = (t+b)/2;
        return countShips(sea, {t, mid_x},        {mid_y+1, l})
             + countShips(sea, topRight,          {mid_y+1, mid_x+1} )
             + countShips(sea, {mid_y, mid_x},    bottomLeft)
             + countShips(sea, {mid_y, r},        {b, mid_x+1});
    }
};
```

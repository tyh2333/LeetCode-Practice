#### [470. Implement Rand10() Using Rand7()](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/implement-rand10-using-rand7/)

Given the **API** `rand7()` that generates a uniform random integer in the range `[1, 7]`, write a function `rand10()` that generates a uniform random integer in the range `[1, 10]`. You can only call the API `rand7()`, and you shouldn't call any other API. Please **do not** use a language's built-in random API.

Each test case will have one **internal** argument `n`, the number of times that your implemented function `rand10()` will be called while testing. Note that this is **not an argument** passed to `rand10()`.

**Follow up:**

- What is the [expected value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value) for the number of calls to `rand7()` function?
- Could you minimize the number of calls to `rand7()`? 

**Example 1:**

```c++
Input: n = 1
Output: [2]
```

**Example 2:**

```c++
Input: n = 2
Output: [2,8]
```

**Example 3:**

```c++
Input: n = 3
Output: [3,8,10]
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 105`

```c++
// The rand7() API is already defined for you.
// int rand7();
// @return a random int in the range 1 to 7

class Solution {
public:
    int rand10() {
        int a=rand7();
        int b=rand7();
        // get a from [1, 6]
        while(a == 7){
            a=rand7();
        }
        // get b from [1, 5]
        while(b > 5){
            b=rand7();
        }
        // possiblity for a is odd is 1/2
        // possiblity for b is 1/5 in [1, 5]
        return (a&1 ? 0 : 5) + b;
    }
};
```



#### [492. Construct the Rectangle](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/construct-the-rectangle/)

A web developer needs to know how to design a web page's size. So, given a specific rectangular web pageâ€™s area, your job by now is to design a rectangular web page, whose length L and width W satisfy the following requirements:

1. The area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the given target area.
2. The width `W` should not be larger than the length `L`, which means `L >= W`.
3. The difference between length `L` and width `W` should be as small as possible.

Return *an array `[L, W]` where `L` and `W` are the length and width of the web page you designed in sequence.* 

**Example 1:**

```c++
Input: area = 4
Output: [2,2]
Explanation: The target area is 4, and all the possible ways to construct it are [1,4], [2,2], [4,1]. 
But according to requirement 2, [1,4] is illegal; according to requirement 3,  [4,1] is not optimal compared to [2,2]. So the length L is 2, and the width W is 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```c++
Input: area = 37
Output: [37,1]
```

**Example 3:**

```c++
Input: area = 122122
Output: [427,286]
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= area <= 10^7`

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> constructRectangle(int area) {
        // (1) if prime: return {prime, 1};
        int width = (int) sqrt(area);
        while(area % width != 0) {
            width--;
        }
        return {area / width, width};
    }
};
```



#### [914. X of a Kind in a Deck of Cards](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/x-of-a-kind-in-a-deck-of-cards/)

In a deck of cards, each card has an integer written on it. Return `true` if and only if you can choose `X >= 2` such that it is possible to split the entire deck into 1 or more groups of cards, where:

- Each group has exactly `X` cards.
- All the cards in each group have the same integer. 

**Example 1:**

```c++
Input: deck = [1,2,3,4,4,3,2,1]
Output: true
Explanation: Possible partition [1,1],[2,2],[3,3],[4,4].
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= deck.length <= 104`
- `0 <= deck[i] < 104`

```c++
// (1) method 1:
class Solution {
public:
    // check if min gcd of all the frequency >= 2:
    int counter[10000];
    bool hasGroupsSizeX(vector<int>& deck) {
        for (auto x: deck) counter[x]++;
        int x = 0;
        for(auto cnt: counter) {
            if (cnt > 0) {
                x = gcd(x, cnt); 
                if (x == 1) { 
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
        return x >= 2;
    }
    int gcd(int a, int b){
        return b == 0 ? a : gcd(b, a % b);
    }
};
```

#### [989. Add to Array-Form of Integer](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/add-to-array-form-of-integer/)

The **array-form** of an integer `num` is an array representing its digits in left to right order.

- For example, for `num = 1321`, the array form is `[1,3,2,1]`.

Given `num`, the **array-form** of an integer, and an integer `k`, return *the **array-form** of the integer* `num + k`.

**Example 1:**

```c++
Input: num = [1,2,0,0], k = 34
Output: [1,2,3,4]
Explanation: 1200 + 34 = 1234
```

**Example 2:**

```c++
Input: num = [2,7,4], k = 181
Output: [4,5,5]
Explanation: 274 + 181 = 455
```

**Example 3:**

```c++
Input: num = [2,1,5], k = 806
Output: [1,0,2,1]
Explanation: 215 + 806 = 1021
```

**Example 4:**

```c++
Input: num = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9], k = 1
Output: [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
Explanation: 9999999999 + 1 = 10000000000 
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= num.length <= 104`
- `0 <= num[i] <= 9`
- `num` does not contain any leading zeros except for the zero itself.
- `1 <= k <= 104`

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> addToArrayForm(vector<int>& A, int K) {
        // vector has no push_front, so reverse
		reverse(A.begin(), A.end());
		int index = 0;
		while (K > 0){
			if (index < A.size()){
				K += A[index];
				A[index] = K % 10;  // not out of bound
			}
			else A.push_back(K % 10); // out of bound, push
			K /= 10;
			++index;
		}
		reverse(A.begin(), A.end());
		return A;
    }
};
```
